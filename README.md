# Guess the Number Game 🎯

My very first game on GitHub!

A simple browser game where you try to guess a secret number between 1 and 100.

## How to play
1. Just open `index.html` in any browser (no server needed!)
2. Type your guess and press "Guess!"
3. I'll tell you if it's too high or too low.

## Features
- Beautiful gradient background
- Counts your attempts
- Play again button when you win

Made with ❤️ using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Feel free to fork and improve it! This is my first project ever.
